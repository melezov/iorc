Insertion-order retaining collections for Scala.
Not to be confused with Ordered collections.

USAGE:

  import scala.collections.RetSet
  ...

MOTIVATION:

RetCol provides mutable and immutable Set and Map collections in which
the order in which the ordering remains the same upon additional inserts.

Currently, the Scala library offers some of these functionalities through
scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashSet/Map and
scala.collection.immutable.ListSet/Map collections but these implementations
do not provide constant time element access.

With RetCol mutable collections it is possible to achieve O(1) insertion,
retrieval and removal of elements through additional overhead of having
two underlying collections. It is best suited for smaller collection
sizes where the price of the additional memory footprint can be leveraged
against constant time access.

RetCol immutable collections offer dual retrieval options, either through
an element index or through the underlying Hash collection.
